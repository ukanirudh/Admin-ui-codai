# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `To Run the App`
In the project directory, you can run:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Available Scripts
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.


Few things considered:
1. Use of basic bootstrap components to improve the representation of the app & enhance user experience. No other library is used.
2. App is bootstrapped with create-react-app
3. Improvised 'edit' functionality with providing a modal
